# DebutDeploy API Reference

DebutDeploy is a Render-style control panel that proxies Coolify. This document covers
the REST API so a developer — or Claude Code / CI with an API token — can drive it
programmatically: create services, trigger and monitor deploys, read logs, set env vars,
manage databases, and more.

Every route below is grounded in `server/index.js` (all routes are defined inline there).

## Base URL

```
https://app.debutdepoly.com
```

Local dev: `http://localhost:8787` (the Vite UI on `:5173`/`:5180` proxies `/api` to it).

All responses are JSON. On error you get `{ "error": "..." }` with a 4xx/5xx status.
5xx bodies are always the generic `"Internal error"` (upstream detail is logged server-side,
never forwarded).

---

## Authentication

Most `/api/*` routes require auth. Two mechanisms are accepted:

1. **Session cookie** — set by the browser login flow (GitHub OAuth). Used by the UI.
2. **Bearer API token** — for programmatic access (Claude Code / CI). Send:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```
   If there's no session user but a valid Bearer token is present, the request is
   authenticated as that token's owner.

### Minting a token

The easiest way is the web UI: **Account settings → API keys → Create key**. Pick
**Full access** or **Read-only**, then copy the token (shown once).

Tokens are also created, listed, and deleted under `/api/tokens`. **Creating a token requires a
session** (you must be logged into the web UI) — you can't bootstrap a token with a token
alone in a fresh context via the mutate guard's origin check, so mint it from the browser /
an authenticated session, then use it programmatically.

`POST /api/tokens` returns the raw token **once** — only its hash is stored, so copy it
immediately.

```bash
# From an authenticated browser session (cookie + same-origin), create a token:
curl -X POST https://app.debutdepoly.com/api/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --cookie "…session cookie…" \
  -d '{"name":"ci-deploy","scope":"full"}'
# → { "id": 3, "name": "ci-deploy", "scope": "full", "token": "…copy me, shown once…" }
```

### Key scope: full vs read-only

Each key carries a **scope**:

- **`full`** (default) — can do anything the key's owner can do; ordinary
  ownership + role (RBAC) checks still apply.
- **`read`** — may only make **GET/HEAD** requests. Any write (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
  returns `403 {"error":"read-only API key"}`, enforced before the route runs.

This single check covers every Bearer caller — curl, CI, and the MCP server (below) —
so a read-only key is a safe way to grant dashboards or agents look-but-don't-touch access.

Thereafter, use the token on any `/api/*` route:

```bash
curl https://app.debutdepoly.com/api/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN"
```

Notes:
- **Failed-auth throttle**: after **10 failed Bearer attempts from one IP within 60s**,
  further attempts return `429 {"error":"Too many attempts"}` until the window resets.
  Tokens are 192-bit random; this is defense-in-depth against guessing.
- **CSRF / mutate guard**: cookie-authed mutations (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) must be
  `application/json` and carry a same-origin `Origin`/`Referer`, or they get `403`.
  **Bearer-token requests skip this check** (no cookie = no CSRF), so token-driven
  automation just works.
- **Ownership**: non-admin callers only see and act on resources they own. Accessing a
  resource you don't own returns `403`/`404`. Admin callers bypass ownership filtering.
- **Admin-only** routes additionally require `role === "admin"` and return `403` otherwise.

## Use from Claude (MCP)

The [`mcp/`](../mcp) directory ships a Model Context Protocol server that exposes
these endpoints as tools, so Claude Code / Claude Desktop can operate the platform.
It authenticates with the **same API key** — just set it as `DEBUTDEPLOY_TOKEN`:

```bash
claude mcp add debutdeploy \
  -e DEBUTDEPLOY_URL=https://app.debutdepoly.com \
  -e DEBUTDEPLOY_TOKEN=$DD_TOKEN \
  -- node /path/to/debut-deploy/mcp/server.js
```

A **read-only** key restricts the MCP server to read tools (`list_services`,
`service_logs`, …); write tools (`deploy_service`, `create_service`, `control_service`)
return `403`. The Account settings → API keys page shows this exact command with your
token pre-filled after you create a key.

---

## Recipes

Set once:

```bash
export DD=https://app.debutdepoly.com
export DD_TOKEN=…   # from POST /api/tokens (created via an authenticated browser session)
```

### (a) Create & deploy a service

```bash
# 1. Confirm the repo is reachable via your GitHub installation.
curl -s "$DD/api/github/repos" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN" | jq '.[].full_name'

# 2. Create + instant-deploy. Returns { "uuid": "…" }.
UUID=$(curl -s -X POST "$DD/api/apps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo":"myorg/myapp","branch":"main","name":"myapp","port":3000}' \
  | jq -r .uuid)
echo "created $UUID"

# 3. (optional) Add env vars.
curl -s -X POST "$DD/api/services/$UUID/envs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"NODE_ENV","value":"production","is_secret":false}'
```

`POST /api/apps` deploys instantly, so there's a deployment already in flight — monitor it
with recipe (b). To redeploy later: `POST /api/services/$UUID/deploy`.

### (b) Monitor a deploy

Poll deployments until the newest one reaches a terminal state, then dump its build logs.
Coolify statuses are compound (`running:healthy`); deployment status values include
`queued`, `in_progress`, `finished`, `failed`, `cancelled`.

```bash
# Kick a deploy (skip if you just created via /api/apps).
curl -s -X POST "$DD/api/services/$UUID/deploy" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN"

# Poll the latest deployment.
while true; do
  DEP=$(curl -s "$DD/api/services/$UUID/deployments" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN" | jq '.[0]')
  STATUS=$(echo "$DEP" | jq -r '.status')
  echo "status: $STATUS"
  case "$STATUS" in
    finished|failed|cancelled) break ;;
  esac
  sleep 5
done

# Build/deploy logs for that deployment.
DEP_UUID=$(echo "$DEP" | jq -r '.uuid')
curl -s "$DD/api/services/$UUID/deployments/$DEP_UUID/logs" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN"

# Runtime logs once it's up.
curl -s "$DD/api/services/$UUID/logs" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN"
```

> Field names for deployment objects (`.status`, `.uuid`) come from Coolify's normalised
> shape. If your account returns different keys, inspect one object first:
> `curl -s "$DD/api/services/$UUID/deployments" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DD_TOKEN" | jq '.[0]'`.
